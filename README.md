You are encouraged to search online for solutions, and discuss the homework with your classmates. You should however write the assignment answers yourself. You should also cite the online source or person that helped you arrive at your solution as inline comment in your code.

Homeworks should be submitted only as PDF files through <https://canvas.uw.edu>. Note that you can export both `Rmarkdown` documents and `Jupyter` notebooks to PDF. Check before submission that the PDF file looks as you expect it to be.

If you need to submit a homework late, please check with the instructor at least 24 hours before the due date.

## Grading

Each homework will count for 20% of your final grade.

In-class participation will count for the remaining 20% of your final grade.
